# ICS4U - CPT: Data Interaction and Visualization

The data set that we are using is the monthly COVID-19 cases for each country during the year 2020. This is based on each country's confirmed cases and helps give a visualization of how COVID-19 was spread throughout the months by displaying trends in different countries. We have chosen this data set because this topic affected a lot of people throughout the world. We are all living in a pandemic, and have no idea when it will be over. All of us have been impacted by COVID-19; whether you got the virus or know someone who did. We all had a difficult time adjusting to this pandemic, that is why we chose this data to see how COVID-19 spread throughout the world. To be able to see which countries were impacted by COVID-19 the most and detect trends to understand where the country is headed. Furthermore, we are able to use our data to adopt some strategies of countries that did well in recovering from COVID-19. In conclusion, our dataset detects and visualizes COVID-19 cases throughout the world and provides a better understanding and knowledge in the topic.
